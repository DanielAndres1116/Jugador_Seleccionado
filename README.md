Sean Lahman is an investigative reporter who has collected a large amount of information about the teams that are part of the major leagues in the United States.

The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum located in New York is where all the history of this sport in the United States can be found. To be elected to the Hall of Fame, the following criteria must be met:

•	Competed in at least ten seasonsRetired for at least five seasons
•	Approval by a selection committee to be included on the ballot (usually players who have played ten or more years are considered worthy)
•	Must not be on the ineligible list (this means the player must not be expelled from baseball)
•	Considered elected if they receive at least 75% of the votes in the election
•	A player remains on the ballot if they receive at least 5% of the votes and remain for a maximum of 10 years
•	With this knowledge, the goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a Major League Baseball player will be voted into the Hall of Fame.
